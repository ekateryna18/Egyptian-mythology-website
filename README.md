Egyptian mythology website project
Used HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript for the buttons, to create this website from scratch.
The top bar menu is hiding when scrolling down, there is a botton in the corner, that appears after the second slide, the brings us to the top. On the last slide with pictures, when putting the mouse on top of them, they rotate, exposing information and the name of the god/goddes. And in the end there are buttons for contact.
